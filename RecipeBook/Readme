A interactive Recipe book app made with create-react-app that is connected to firebase.

1) View induvidual recipes that have their seperate cards.
2) Expand the cards to see the details of your recipe
3) Added new recipes
4) Delete the recipes that you do not need
5) Edit your recipes just in case you decide to add some extra flavor

Recipes are dynamically updated as you keep adding/delete/edit them.

important!! 
Packages to be added : 
  npm i bootstrap
  npm i bootstrap-icons
  npm i firebase

Ps : I'll be adding additional field of cusine for all the recipes next so that they can be sorted and a new field of
"collections" can be adde to page navigation bar.
